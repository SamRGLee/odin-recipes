    <h2>Ingreedients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>400g rice noodles</li>
            <li>5 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 bell pepper, sliced</li>
            <li>1 carrot, sliced</li>
            <li>5 mushrooms</li>
            <li>2 spring onions, sliced</li>
            <li>A handful of red cabbage</li>
            <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>2.5 tbsp curry powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp white pepper</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place rice noodles in a large bowl and cover with boiling water. Let stand until pliable, about 5 minutes. Drain noodles in a colander, then transfer to a rimmed baking sheet with a wire rack set in it. Spread noodles in an even layer, then, using scissors, cut noodles in half.</li>
            <li>Place garlic in a small bowl and add 2 teaspoons curry powder along with soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, white pepper, sugar, remaining 2 teaspoons fish sauce. Mix well, thinning with 2 teaspoons water, then set sauce aside.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 teaspoon canola oil in a wok or nonstick skillet over high heat, tilting to swirl oil, until smoking. Add eggs and let cook undisturbed for about 10 second, then gently move the eggs back and forth with a spatula until they start to firm up. Break eggs into small pieces, then set aside in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Add red bell pepper and snow peas and stir for another 30 seconds, then add carrots. Add remaining 1 teaspoon curry powder, season with salt, and cook, tossing, until curry is evenly distributed. Scrape wok contents into bowl with eggs.</li>
            <li>Add rice-stick noodles and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Stir in sauce until curry powder is evenly distributed, adding water 1 or 2 teaspoons at a time as needed to help distribute sauce. Return egg, shrimp, roast pork, and vegetables to wok and stir-fry until everything is evenly combined, about 30 seconds. Season with salt and remove from heat. Add scallions, drizzle with sesame oil, mix well, and transfer to a large serving bowl. </li>
        </ol>
