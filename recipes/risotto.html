    <h2>Ingreedients</h2>
    
    <ul> 
        <li>500g risotto rice</li>
        <li>3 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>25g butter</li>
        <li>4 mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 tsp white wine</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
       <ol> 
            <li> Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/ gas 4. Chop up the pumpkin or squash into 1.5cm cubes (kids- ask for help if it’s slippery). Put it on a baking tray, drizzle over some oil, then roast for 30 mins.</li>
            
            <li> While the pumpkin is roasting, you can make the risotto. Put the garlic in a sandwich bag, then bash lightly with a rolling pin until it’s crushed. </li>
            
            <li> Cut up the spring onions with your scissors. </li>
            
            <li> Heat 1 tbsp oil with the butter in your pan over a medium heat – not too hot. Add the spring onions and garlic. Once the onions are soft but not getting brown, add the rice and cumin. Stir well to coat in the buttery mix for about 1 min.</li>
        </ol>
